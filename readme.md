# Digivice Web App

## Purpose

This project was made a challenge to myself to repeat an earlier web app I made as part of my coding bootcamp with CareerFoundry. 
The previous project is a Pokédex web app, which can be found [here](https://davidrmcintyre.github.io/Javascript-Pokedex-App/)

## Project Description:

A responsive web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail by displaying a list of Digimon as buttons, which when clicked will display a picture of the Digimon as well as their name and level, within a modal.

## Instructions:

Please visit the app [here](https://davidrmcintyre.github.io/digivice-js-app/)
